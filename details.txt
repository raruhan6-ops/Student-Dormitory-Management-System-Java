Student Dormitory Management System – MVP and Project Specification
1. Project Overview
This document describes the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and project structure for a Student Dormitory Management System. It is intended for use as a database course design project, and focuses on clear data modeling, core business logic, and typical usage scenarios that can be implemented within a semester.
1.1 Background
University dormitories host a large number of students. Manual management using paper forms or simple spreadsheets is error-prone and inefficient. A dormitory management system helps administrators manage buildings, rooms, and beds, track student accommodation records, record repair requests, and provide necessary information services to students.
1.2 Objectives
- Provide a basic information system for managing dorm buildings, rooms, beds, and students.
- Record student check-in and check-out, and show current occupancy for each room.
- Allow students (or staff) to submit and track repair requests.
- Provide basic role-based access control (e.g., student vs. dorm manager vs. administrator).
- Demonstrate key database concepts: ER modeling, relational schema design, SQL queries, and simple transaction logic.
1.3 Target Users and Roles
- Student: views personal information and current dorm assignment; submits repair requests.
- Dorm Manager: manages buildings, rooms, beds; assigns students to beds; handles repair requests.
- System Administrator: manages user accounts, roles, and high-level configuration.
2. System Structure Overview
The system is designed as a typical management information system built on a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, openGauss). The recommended architecture is a browser/server (B/S) model with a web application front-end and a database back-end, but the design can also be implemented as a desktop application.
2.1 Logical Architecture
- Presentation Layer: pages or forms for login, student management, dorm management, repair management, and reporting.
- Business Logic Layer: implements operations such as assigning beds, checking in/out, validating business rules, and processing repair requests.
- Data Access Layer: executes SQL statements, manages transactions, and maps database tables to objects or data structures.
- Database Layer: relational database storing all persistent data.
2.2 Main Functional Modules
- User and Authentication Management
- Student Information Management
- Dorm Building, Room, and Bed Management
- Accommodation (Check-In / Check-Out) Management
- Repair Request Management
- Basic Reporting and Querying (optionally export to Excel/PDF for bonus marks)
3. MVP Feature Definition

4. Detailed Functional Requirements
4.1 Use Case: User Login
Purpose: Authenticate users and provide different interfaces based on their roles.
Actors: Student, Dorm Manager, Administrator.
Preconditions: User account exists in the system with a username, password, and role.
Main Flow:
  1. User opens the login page.
  2. User enters username and password.
  3. System verifies the credentials against the UserAccount table.
  4. If valid, the system creates a session and redirects the user to their role-specific home page.
  5. If invalid, the system displays an error message and allows retry.
Postconditions: User is authenticated and can access permitted functionalities.
4.2 Use Case: Manage Student Basic Information
Purpose: Maintain accurate basic information for each student.
Actors: Dorm Manager, Administrator.
Main Operations:
- Add a new student record (StudentID, Name, Gender, Major, Class, Phone, EnrollmentYear).
- Edit existing student information.
- Search students by student ID, name, major, class (with optional fuzzy search).
4.3 Use Case: Manage Buildings, Rooms, and Beds
Purpose: Maintain structural data about dormitories.
Actors: Dorm Manager, Administrator.
Main Operations:
- Add and edit dormitory buildings (name, location, manager).
- Add and edit rooms for each building (room number, capacity, type).
- Add and edit beds within each room (bed number, status).
- View a hierarchical list: Building → Rooms → Beds, including current occupancy.
4.4 Use Case: Student Check-In (Assign Bed)
Purpose: Assign a student to an available bed and record the accommodation.
Actors: Dorm Manager.
Preconditions:
- Student basic information exists.
- Target bed is in status "Available".
Main Flow:
  1. Dorm manager searches and selects a student.
  2. Dorm manager searches and selects an available bed (Building, Room, Bed).
  3. System creates a new CheckInOut record with CheckInDate = today and Status = "CurrentlyLiving".
  4. System updates Bed.Status to "Occupied" and increments Room.CurrentOccupancy.
Postconditions: Student is assigned to a bed and appears in current occupancy lists.
4.5 Use Case: Student Check-Out or Room Change
Purpose: Release beds, record student departures, and support room moves.
Actors: Dorm Manager.
Main Flow for Check-Out:
  1. Dorm manager selects a currently living student.
  2. System finds the active CheckInOut record and sets CheckOutDate = today, Status = "CheckedOut".
  3. System updates the associated bed and room: Bed.Status = "Available", Room.CurrentOccupancy decremented.
Main Flow for Room Change:
  1. Perform a check-out from the old bed as above.
  2. Perform a new check-in to the new bed as in the check-in use case.
4.6 Use Case: Repair Request Management
Purpose: Allow students or staff to record and track repair issues in dorm rooms.
Actors: Student, Dorm Manager.
Main Operations:
- Student submits a repair request specifying room, problem description, and contact information.
- System records the request with status = "Pending".
- Dorm manager views a list of pending requests and assigns a handler.
- After completion, the manager updates status to "Finished" and records FinishTime.
- Both students and managers can view historical repair records.
4.7 Use Case: Querying and Reporting
Purpose: Provide useful information for day-to-day management.
Actors: Dorm Manager, Administrator.
Example Queries:
- List of students in a given building or room.
- Current occupancy vs. capacity for each room.
- All repair requests for a given building during a date range.
- Search students by name (fuzzy), major, or class.
5. Data Model and Database Design
5.1 Entity List and Descriptions
1) Student: stores basic information about each student.
2) DormBuilding: stores information about each dormitory building.
3) Room: stores information about rooms within each building.
4) Bed: stores information about individual beds in rooms.
5) CheckInOut: stores accommodation records (which student lived in which bed and when).
6) RepairRequest: stores repair requests for rooms.
7) FeeRecord (optional for bonus): stores accommodation or related fees per student.
8) UserAccount: stores login account data and roles for the system.
5.2 Relational Schemas (Logical Design)
Student(StudentID PK, Name, Gender, Major, Class, Phone, EnrollmentYear)
DormBuilding(BuildingID PK, BuildingName, Location, ManagerName, ManagerPhone)
Room(RoomID PK, BuildingID FK→DormBuilding, RoomNumber, Capacity, CurrentOccupancy, RoomType)
Bed(BedID PK, RoomID FK→Room, BedNumber, Status)
CheckInOut(RecordID PK, StudentID FK→Student, BedID FK→Bed, CheckInDate, CheckOutDate, Status)
RepairRequest(RepairID PK, RoomID FK→Room, SubmitterStudentID FK→Student, Description, SubmitTime, Status, Handler, FinishTime)
FeeRecord (optional)(FeeID PK, StudentID FK→Student, FeeType, Amount, PayDate, Remark)
UserAccount(UserID PK, Username, PasswordHash, Role, RelatedStudentID FK→Student)
5.3 Example Table Definitions (SQL Sketch)
Example: Student table (MySQL-style syntax):
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID      VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name           VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Gender         CHAR(1) CHECK (Gender IN ('M', 'F')),
    Major          VARCHAR(100),
    Class          VARCHAR(50),
    Phone          VARCHAR(20),
    EnrollmentYear INT
);
Example: Room table:
CREATE TABLE Room (
    RoomID           INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    BuildingID       INT NOT NULL,
    RoomNumber       VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    Capacity         INT NOT NULL,
    CurrentOccupancy INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    RoomType         VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (BuildingID) REFERENCES DormBuilding(BuildingID)
);
5.4 Constraints and Business Rules
- For each bed, at most one CheckInOut record may have Status = "CurrentlyLiving".
- For each room, CurrentOccupancy must never exceed Capacity.
- Only beds with Status = "Available" may be assigned to students.
- When a student checks out, the related bed must become "Available" and room occupancy decremented.
- UserAccount.Role should be restricted to predefined values such as "Student", "DormManager", "Admin".
6. Example Operations and Usage Scenarios
6.1 Scenario: Add a New Student and Assign a Bed
1) Dorm manager adds a new student record:
INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, Name, Gender, Major, Class, Phone, EnrollmentYear)
VALUES ('20250001', 'Alice Wang', 'F', 'Computer Science', 'CS2301', '13800000001', 2025);
2) Dorm manager searches for available beds in Building A, Room 301:
SELECT BedID, BedNumber FROM Bed b
JOIN Room r ON b.RoomID = r.RoomID
JOIN DormBuilding d ON r.BuildingID = d.BuildingID
WHERE d.BuildingName = 'Building A'
  AND r.RoomNumber = '301'
  AND b.Status = 'Available';
3) Dorm manager assigns the student to BedID = 15:
INSERT INTO CheckInOut (StudentID, BedID, CheckInDate, Status)
VALUES ('20250001', 15, CURRENT_DATE, 'CurrentlyLiving');

UPDATE Bed SET Status = 'Occupied' WHERE BedID = 15;

UPDATE Room SET CurrentOccupancy = CurrentOccupancy + 1
WHERE RoomID = (SELECT RoomID FROM Bed WHERE BedID = 15);
6.2 Scenario: Student Moves to Another Room
1) Close old accommodation record:
UPDATE CheckInOut
SET CheckOutDate = CURRENT_DATE, Status = 'CheckedOut'
WHERE StudentID = '20250001' AND Status = 'CurrentlyLiving';
2) Free the old bed and decrease occupancy:
UPDATE Bed SET Status = 'Available'
WHERE BedID = (SELECT BedID FROM CheckInOut
               WHERE StudentID = '20250001'
               ORDER BY RecordID DESC LIMIT 1);
3) Assign a new bed (similar to the previous scenario) and update occupancy accordingly.
6.3 Scenario: Student Submits a Repair Request
1) Student fills in a repair form describing the issue.
2) System identifies the student’s current room via CheckInOut and Bed → Room relations.
3) System inserts a new RepairRequest record:
INSERT INTO RepairRequest (RoomID, SubmitterStudentID, Description, SubmitTime, Status)
VALUES (
    @RoomID, -- derived from current bed
    '20250001',
    'Water leakage in bathroom',
    NOW(),
    'Pending'
);
6.4 Scenario: Manager Views Current Occupancy by Room
Example query:
SELECT d.BuildingName, r.RoomNumber, r.Capacity, r.CurrentOccupancy
FROM Room r
JOIN DormBuilding d ON r.BuildingID = d.BuildingID
ORDER BY d.BuildingName, r.RoomNumber;
7. Non-Functional Requirements
- Usability: Interfaces should be simple and clear, suitable for non-technical staff.
- Performance: The system should respond within a reasonable time (e.g., < 2 seconds for typical queries) for the expected number of students and rooms.
- Reliability: Operations that modify multiple tables (e.g., check-in, check-out, room change) should use transactions to ensure consistency.
- Security: Passwords must be stored as hashes, not in plain text. Login forms should avoid SQL injection by using prepared statements or parameterized queries.
- Maintainability: Code and database structures should be clearly documented, with meaningful names for tables, columns, and procedures.
8. Future Extensions
- Add fee management (accommodation fees, penalties, etc.) with detailed reports and payment status.
- Provide dashboards for occupancy statistics, such as occupancy rate per building or gender distribution.
- Integrate with authentication systems (e.g., campus single sign-on).
- Add a mobile-friendly or mini-program front-end for students to view information and submit requests.
- Implement more advanced search and filtering, including combined conditions and fuzzy search on multiple fields.
